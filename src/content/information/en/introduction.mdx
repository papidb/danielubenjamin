As a versatile software engineer with six years of industry experience, I've developed expertise across multiple technology stacks, including React, React Native, Node.js, and Go.

**Key Achievements:**

- Led a successful overhaul of the product process, resulting in a **30% faster feature deployment rate**
- Reduced crash rate from **5.57% to 0.39%**
- Migrated a music app from MP3 to AAC with HLS, **reducing buffer time by 50%**

Specializing in mobile and back-end technologies, I architect scalable solutions and drive innovation. I'm an active open-source contributor to [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) (61k+ GitHub stars) and recently completed advanced courses in cloud architecture.

My analytical approach, combined with strong collaboration skills, enables me to tackle complex challenges and deliver high-impact software solutions.
